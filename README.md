# Set up a "Hello world" project with rails-react gem

By now I've used many different gems with Rails and this exercise will have you connect previous knowledge with new knowledge as you get a chance to use the react-rails gem. This gem allows you to build React components as a part of your Rails JavaScript and serve it in a component, react_component, to be used in a regular ERB file.


## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- Psql
- React

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby (ruby --v)
- Reac
- Postgrestsql (psql --version)
- Node.js (node --v)
- Yarn (yarn --v)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Run in your terminal `git clone git@github.com:Mhdez221993/hello-rails-react.git`
